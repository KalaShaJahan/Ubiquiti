# Home-Network Implementation
Using the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X and Ubiquiti AP-AC-LR Access Point

Have used this setup for the past 5+ years when I got my Ubiquiti.  Just realized that it looks like there is a bakup config file attached for anyone that wants to cheat and just jump to an installation.  If that is a clean config file - what is the user name password to gain access after it has been uploaded?
